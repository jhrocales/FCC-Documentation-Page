            <p class="section-content"> Machine Learning - is a subdomain of Computer Science that focuses on algorithms
                which help a computer learn from data without (a programmer being there telling what to do) 
                also known as explicit programming. Most of machine learning deals with Arrays which is a collection of data 
                as seen in the example below:</p>
            <code class="section-code">
               myArray = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

             Uses labeled inputs (meaning the input has a corresponding output label) to train models and learn outputs. 
             To a computer, pictures are just pixels with colors, there is really no “learning” going on. When we attach “labels” to these pixels, the computer is learning based on images 
             to depict what a picture signifies. Below is an example line of code using scikit-learn in Python 
            </p>
            <code class="section-code">
               from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression <br>
               model = LinearRegression() <br>
            </code>
            <code class="section-code">
               model.fit(X_train, y_train) <br>

               Uses unlabeled data to learn about patterns in data. again, to a computer, all images are just pixels with colors, there is really no “learning” going on.
               but when we feed all a lot of images to a computer, it will start clustering these images based on the pattern it sees such as what is in common with these various images.
               Below is an example of a simple unsupervised learning code using scikit-learn in Python, specifically for training a K-means clustering model:
            </p>
            <code class="section-code">
               model.fit(X)

               Machine/agent learning in an interactive environment based on rewards and penalties.
               <ul>
                  <li> 
                     like training a dog, there isn't necessarily structure on what is “right” or “wrong”, just the things that we teach the dog what it is. If we believe what the dog is doing is right ->
                      we reward the dog. If we think what the dog is doing is wrong -> we penalize the dog.
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     similar to training a dog wherein there is not a inherent “good” or “bad” moral compass, we teach the computer to do something then reward it if it is right and penalize it if it is doing wrong.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               Below is an example of a single line of code for reinforcement learning using the OpenAI Gym library, specifically for taking an action in an environment:
            </p>
            <code class="section-code">
               observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
